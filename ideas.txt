Top three:
1) Is it possible to predict heart rate from Skateboard speed

Research has been done to detect the tricks performed by actors using gyroscopic sensors

2) Possible to predict what gear are you in for your bike based off of velocity and acceleration

Similar research has been done regarding the use of accelerometer and gyroscope chips in smartphones to detect some aspect of cycling but not gear changes.

3) Washing machine to detect when someone puts to many clothes in from movement of washing machine

Seems like a lot of people have used a similar approach to detect when the washing machine stops, but I have not found one that does anomaly detection

Bottom three:
4) Failing hard-drive 

5) Tire Pressure Across vehicles

6) Phone on floor of car to detect potholes
